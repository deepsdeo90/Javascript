Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
"Buzz" instead.

modify your program to print "FizzBuzz",
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5
